Currently, I am a fourth-year PhD student of [Websoft](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=%E4%B8%87%E7%BB%B4%E7%BD%91%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E7%BB%84) Research Group at Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University. I received my B.Sc. degree in June 2016 from Chongqing University. 
In the same year, I was admitted to study for a Ph.D. degree at Nanjing University without entrance examination. 
I'm also doing an internship at Tongyi Laboratory, Alibaba Group from July 2024.
