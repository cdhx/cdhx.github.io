Currently, I am a fourth-year PhD student of [Websoft](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=%E4%B8%87%E7%BB%B4%E7%BD%91%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E7%BB%84) Research Group at [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/). 
I received my B.Sc. degree in June 2020 from [Chongqing University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/). 
In the same year, I was admitted to study for a Ph.D. degree at Nanjing University under the supervision of Prof. [Yuzhong Qu](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/~yzqu). 

I'm also doing an internship at [Tongyi Laboratory, Alibaba Group](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/) from July 2024.

Feel free to reach out to me if you’re interested in my research.
